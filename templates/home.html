            <p> <h2>Our Inspiration </h2> <br>
                <h4> The inspiration for our project stemmed from the firsthand experiences of our frontend engineer, who is currently an undergraduate at the University of Lagos, Nigeria. </h4>
                <br>
                <h4> Challenges we aimed to address: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Difficulty in accessing educational materials sent by lecturers. </li>
                    <li> Inefficiencies and irresponsibility of middlemen (class representatives) meant to distribute these materials. </li>
                    <li> Delays in receiving resources, impacting learning and exam preparation. </li>
                    <li> Financial constraints in acquiring handouts, leading to reliance on friends for study materials. </li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Our frontend engineer recounted numerous instances where students were lost during lectures due to not having received the necessary resources. Similar challenges were faced by other team members during their university days. These shared experiences motivated us to develop a solution that ensures timely and equitable access to educational resources for all students.</p>
